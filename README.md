# student_marks_clustering
This is a clustering project based on the student scores in their final exam. I have segregated students into two clusters based on their scores in the particular sessions of the exam to determine their level of understanding in the topic is poor or good.
Additionally implemented various ML algorithms to predict the average score the each student combined through all the sessions in a test.
Randomforest regressor gave the best result with a mean square error of 0.7.
